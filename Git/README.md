### Development flow
![Flow image](flow.png "Typical development flow")

### Branch naming
Branches are usually named in following style:
- ticket number
- initials of the programmer
- short summary of the task

Depending on the projects, some of those can be ommited.

Example:
```
17-ap-new-guidelines
```

### Code review
Upon finishing your changes, you should inform everyone and request a code review. Reviewer can be assigned or volounteer if they have no other tickets at the moment. Branch designed for code review should be updated with ``master``, with all conflicts resolved.
During code review you should make sure code is readable and follows [Swift Guidelines](/Style). After review, if the solution got accepted, reviewer should merge reviewed branch into master and **delete it afterwards**.

### Merge and rebase
While developing on your own branch, you should make sure it's up to date with master. Updates can be handled by ``merge`` or ``rebase`` commands.

Rebase helps keep cleaner history, but it can be used only for local branches that haven't been pushed yet. In other instances, you have to use ``merge`` command.

### Commit messages
Commit messages should be written in English and start with capital letter. Verbs have to be in simple form (ex. fix, add, apply, change).
If commit needs context, it should be added in new paragraph.
If a single commit fixes bug from project.coop, ticket number should be referenced.
Emojis are encouraged if they fit the context.
